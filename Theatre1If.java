/** 
More Problems on Selection Statements
Problem 1: 
Your local theatre charges different prices during the week and during the weekends.  The prices are outlined
in the table below:
Day:				Price:
Monday - Thursday		â‚¬20
Friday - Sunday			â‚¬30
You have been asked to develop an application that allows a user to enter the day of the week
and then display the cost of a theatre ticket for that person based on the day of the week. 
Use instantiable classes in your application.  Save the instantiable class as Theatre1If.java
Theatre1If.java -- the instantiable class, uses the if selection statement to determine the price of a theatre ticket 
based on a given day

	/* version#1 no hints
	private int day;
	
	
	public Theatre1If(int day) {
		if(day >=1 && day <= 4) {
			System.out.println("Ticket price is 20EUR");
		}else if(day >= 5 && day<=7) {
			System.out.println("Ticket price is 30EUR");
		}else {
			System.out.println("Please check your input");

        // the program should work irrespective of the way the day is written
        // (e.g. lower case, upper case or a combination of the two)
        // therefore we must convert all the letters to either lower case or upper case
        // convert the way the day is written to lower case and store the result into the instance variable day
        // we can store the lower case version in the instance variable day
        // because we do not need the previous content (i.e. value) of that variable
        // because we converted the day to lower case the selection statement
        // should check the day against lower case Strings that represent the names of the days
        // uses the if selection statement to determine the price of a theatre ticket
        // based on a given day
        // why is this else branch needed? -- if the user entered an invalid day then we should not provide 
		// a valid price for the ticket
